This is a web page created for the "Curso em VÃ­deo", HTML and CSS course challenge. 
I did this one before of the chapter 17 where Gustavo Guanabara guided the coding of this same website.

In this course, I learned to use HTML tags semantically and to use CSS to styles, besides creating responsive applications.
